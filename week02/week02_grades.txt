This week is worth 9 points.  You've earned 5.0.

NOTE: There was something odd about how your multiple choice answers were entered, as if they were using a different characterset.  I had to go in and edit your notebook for it grade properly.  I'll take a look at week03 to see if that issue comes up again.  I assume it has something to do with keyboard settings.  No worries, but I wanted you to be aware.

Your mistake on the last problem was that you hard-coded 0.75 kg/wk even though that was one of the parameters to the function.
