# Midterm Feedback

## Overall Score: 
46 / 50

Nice work overall!!  One of the steps that I asked for was to look for a way to optimize how much code you have to write by creating fewer functions. (-1)  See my explanation for a good way to do that.



## Part 1: Creating a JSON Rules File
Comments - Well done, generally, but I'm not seeing any of the hierarchical (aka multi-step) cases.  I'm guessing that you've put some of the logic inside of your functions.  (-1)

## Part 2: Functions to evaluate rules
### 2A Organ Failure History
Comments - Nicely done.  The only gap is that it will throw an error if you provide an input that isn't in the list.  (-1)

### 2B Age Score
Comments - Nicely done.

### 2C Temperature
Comments - Nicely done.

### 2D pH
Comments - Nicely done.

### 2E Heart Rate
Comments - Nicely done.

### 2F Respirator Rate
Comments - Nicely done.

### 2G Sodium
Comments - Nicely done.

### 2H Potassium
Comments - Nicely done.

### 2I Creatinine
Comments - It works, but the intent was to put all of the logic into the JSON.

### 2J Hematocrit
Comments - Nicely done.

### 2K FiO2
Comments - It works, but the goal was to put logic into the JSON rather than here.

### 2L Glasgow
Comments - That was an easy one!


## Part 3: Put it all together
Comments - Nice and simple.  Would have looked prettier if you'd used the += operator.


## Part 4: Accessing and processing the patient file
Comments - I see you answers, but no code for where you compared this with the provided answers.  (-1)
